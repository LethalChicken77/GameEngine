# GameEngine
 
This is a game engine written in C++ using Vulkan as the backend. 

Build system: Cmake + Ninja
External dependencies can be found in CMakeLists.txt, ensure you have a recent version of Vulkan installed. I intend to make it easier to build in the future, but in the meantime if you wish to use this as the starting point for your own projects you will have to figure out how to build it on your own.
